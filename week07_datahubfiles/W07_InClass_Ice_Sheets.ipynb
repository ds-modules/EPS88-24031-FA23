    "As Earth scientists, we like to make plots that convey the most information with the least amount of effort for the viewer.  2D directional data are much better represented as 'rose diagrams', which are really just histograms plotted around a circle. They are also known as _polar_ projections as they could be used to make a map of the Earth looking down at one of the poles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow these steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "- For rose diagrams, we will create a  plot instance (called ```fig```) with the ```plt.subplot()``` function.  We make it a _polar_ plot by setting the ```polar``` keyword to ```True```. \n",
    "- The _polar_ type of subplot has funny coordinates set as default, funny to an Earth scientist at least.  The orientations go around counterclockwise instead of clockwise (like map directions). To make it seem more normal for Earth science data,  we have to switch around the directions to geographic coordinates.  We do this with the **fig.set_theta_direction(-1)** function where the '-1' tells **matplotlib** that we want the numbers to go around clockwise, instead of the default (which for some unknown reason goes counter clockwise).  \n",
    "- We also have to put '0' at the top of the diagram (because it is 'North' in Earth science).  We do that with the ```fig.set_theta_zero_location('N')``` call, which tells ```matplotlib``` to put 0 on top (instead of on the right side which is the default).  \n",
    "-  We have to define some bins, sort of like histograms but around azimuthal circle, and count up how many directions are in each bin.  We will use a bin size of 10$^{\\circ}$.  Fortunately, ```plt.hist()``` will count up the number of directional data in each bin for us! Usually we just use ```plt.hist()``` to make the plot, but we can also have it return the bins and the number in each bin.\n",
    "- We will use the  plot function **plt.bar()** which normally makes bar charts, but will make rose diagrams if the plot is _polar_.\n",
    "- Finally, we will plot the data on the figure instance. \n",
