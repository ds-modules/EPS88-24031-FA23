Beyond this time span, the chaotic evolution of the orbits prevents a precise determination of the Earth's motion.

You can get such estimates here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/5792 associated with this paper (Huybers, P. 2006, https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3382981/Huybers_EarlyPleistoceneSummer.pdf). \n",

    "- According to Fourier, any periodic function $f(t)$ can be represented as the sum of a series of sines and cosines:   \n",

Each $k$th-wave has a different amplitude and frequency, higher $k$ waves have higher frequency.\n",

    "Let us take advantage of a `signal.periodogram` function in the `scipy` package.  That module has functions that allow us to  calculate the _power spectral density_ for a time series.  As a result we will be able to generate a _periodogram_, which is a plot of power versus frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use a _window_ in the periodogram calculation.  What a _window_ does is multiply the time series by a function (called a taper) that weights information, suppressing data at the edges of the window and focussing on the center of the window.  The simplest window is a _box car_ which gives equal weight to everything inside the window.  In the following, we will use a _Hann window_ which looks more like a bell curve.
